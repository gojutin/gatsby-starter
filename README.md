## Linting
This project includes tight **ESLint** rules to ensure quality code. Many of the rules favor a functional approach with a strong emphasis on immutability and strong type definitions. Please visit the `.eslintrc.js` file to get a full list of the rules that are applied.

The **ESLint** rules are listed as key/value pairs. The key represents the rule name and the value (number) represents the setting of the rule:

`0` : off

`1`: warn

`2`: error

Here is an example of a rule:
```
"immutable/no-this": 2
```
This particular rule disallows the use of the `this` keyword, which will result in an error. 

## Deployment
Lint your files and fix all linting issues.
```sh
npm run lint
```
Run your test suite and fix any broken tests.
```sh
npm run test
```

Compile a production build to the `/public` directory.
```sh
npm run build
```

## Styling
This library is pre-configured to work with **Styled-Components** and **TailwindCSS**, which can be used together:

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components';
import tw from 'tailwind.macro';

const Wrapper = styled.div`
  ${tw`bg-blue`};
  color: white;
`
```

You can also use the `css` prop, which is part of the **Styled-Components** library:

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components';
import tw from 'tailwind.macro';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div css={tw`bg-blue`}>
    <h1 css={`
      color: #333; 
      ${tw`font-sans`}
    `}
    >Hello APS!</h1>
  </div>
)
```

## Storybook
Storybook is available by creating stories in the `src/stories` directory and running the `npm run storybook` script. Your storybook will be availble at [https://localhost:6006](https://localhost:6006).

You can also compile a production build of your Storybook by running `npm run build:storybook`. The compiled production build will be located in a `/storybook-static` directory.
